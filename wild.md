# Wild-Goppa-code decoder

This is a simple Python script available which demonstrates how
to decode wild Goppa codes. The construction of the codes and the
decoding algorithm are described in detail in the article
[Wild McEliece](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/410)
which is joined work with 
[Daniel J. Bernstein](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/410)
and
[Tanja Lange](http://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/).

Run the script using [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/)
which is a free open-source mathematics software system.

### Note
The use of wild Goppa codes was shown to be unsuitable for the
McEliece cryptosystem in 
[this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/112.pdf).
However, this does not undermine the beauty of the codes which
are alternant codes, i.e., a generalization of BCH
codes.
